2. **Never take destructive actions without confirmation**
   - Always confirm before deleting, overwriting, or modifying critical data
   - When in doubt, ask for user approval

3. **Move completed tasks to Done**
   - Once a task is finished, move its file from Inbox or Needs_Action to Done
   - Update the Dashboard accordingly

4. **Keep task files structured**
   - Use consistent Markdown formatting
   - Include: Title, Description, Status, Date Created, Date Completed (if applicable)

5. **If unsure, ask for clarification**
