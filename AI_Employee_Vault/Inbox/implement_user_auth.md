# Implement User Authentication System

We need to add a user authentication system to the application. This is urgent and should be completed ASAP.

## Requirements
- User login and registration
- Password hashing and security
- Session management
- JWT token implementation
- Integration with existing database

## Additional Notes
This feature is critical for the upcoming release. Multiple components will need to be updated including the API, frontend, and database schema.
